# Qiskit-IBM-Quantum
Small projects I have created, mostly related to single qubit decoherence rates.

These are some files from the first few months of my introduction to IBM quantum and Qiskit software. I recently began doing research related to 
dynamical decoupling and decoherence free subspaces so I have pushed some of my preparatory notebooks onto this repository as well. I'm excited to
continue learning about Qiskit and cleaning up my code so that it is more recreatable.
